  titles:
  - Oh no...
  - The path !
  details:
  - This scarecrow is weird... I feel like I should destroy it if I want to get out
    of here alive.
  - The path is also blocked by this cracked wall.
  - Hey... It looks like the artifact can fire ! The small projectiles should be
    enough to kill the scarecrow, but I will have to fire myself to destroy the wall.
  - (Press and hold to fire a bigger projectile.)
